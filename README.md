# TimeLance
 A Browser Extension to track Session Times (for freelancing etc.).  
  
-Should work on both Firefox and Chromium.  
-Uses Extension Local Storage to store session data.  
-Date & Timepickers were set in Place since native Input Pickers do not work on Firefox in the Extension Popup  

Currently you can add sessions manually or by pressing the play/pause button in the top bar.
