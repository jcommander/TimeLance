# TimeLance
 A Browser Extension to track Times (for freelancing e.g.)
Should work on both Firefox and Chromium
Made with:  
Vanilla JS +  
[WebExtension Polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill) +  
[VanillaJS Datepicker](https://github.com/mymth/vanillajs-datepicker) +  
[Timepicker (only on CodePen)](https://codepen.io/Lance-Jernigan/pen/jrRLLO) +  
[Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)  
Date & Timepickers were set in Place since native Input Popups/Pickers do not work on Firefox in the Extension Popup
